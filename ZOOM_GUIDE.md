## Zoom Integration in Halaka Creation

Zoom meeting creation is fully integrated in the [Halaka module](#).

- When a teacher creates a new halaka (`POST /api/v1/halaka/`), a **recurring Zoom meeting is created automatically** in the pre-save hook.
- The Zoom meeting's info is saved within the Halaka object:
  - `meetingId`
  - `password`
  - `joinUrl`
  - `startUrl`
- The recurrence pattern respects the halaka's schedule (`startDate`, `endDate`, `days`, and frequency).
- The created Zoom meeting can be accessed from the halaka's `zoomMeeting` field.

**No manual action is needed from the frontend to make Zoom meetings for halakatâ€”it's automatic.**

---

## Typical Flow for Zoom Usage

1. **Teacher creates halaka:**
   - Halaka is created with schedule, and a Zoom meeting is automatically provisioned (with recurrence) for the entire period.
   - The Zoom meeting details are returned as part of the halaka object.

2. **Client (browser or mobile) wants to join session:**
   - Frontend obtains:
     - The Zoom meeting number (`zoomMeeting.meetingId`)
     - The Zoom password and joinUrl
     - A signature for the SDK using `/zoom/signature` endpoint

3. **Advanced/host flows:**
   - To start a meeting as host in native Zoom client or SDK, the frontend may use ZAK token via `/zoom/zak-token`.

---

## Errors & Validation

- All errors are returned as JSON with a `status` and a `message`.
- Missing parameters in requests yield `400` errors with a message specifying the missing field.
- If Zoom API credentials/config are missing/misconfigured, a `500` error is returned.

---

## Example: Join a Meeting as Attendee (Frontend Flow)

1. Get `meetingNumber` and `password` from the halaka's `zoomMeeting` field.
2. POST to `/api/v1/zoom/signature` with:
```

{ "meetingNumber": "74382934944", "role": 0 }

```
Save the `signature` from the response.
3. Launch Zoom Web SDK or Native client using these values:
```

ZoomMtg.init(...);
ZoomMtg.join({ meetingNumber, userName, signature, apiKey, password });

```

```
